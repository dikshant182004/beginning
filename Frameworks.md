## What are Frameworks:
  - Frameworks provide a pre-defined structure for software development through libraries, tools, and conventions.
  - They are used to create complex software efficiently with minimal amount of code.
  - They let you focus on high-level functionality of application because framework take cares of low-level.
  - They can be understood as a languages but technically they are not. Frameworks are written on top of programming languages to create a perception of a language.

## Types of Frameworks:
- #### Web Frameworks:
  - ##### Frontend Frameworks:
    These frameworks are used to create the **frontend** of a website. The frontend refers to its parts or components visible to the end-user, such as layout, graphics, navigation, typography, the position of various elements, etc.
    **Ex: React, Angular and Vue JS**.
  - ##### Backend Frameworks:
    These frameworks are server-side frameworks used to design Logic for our server that how it will process each request incomming on different routes.
    **Ex: Express JS, Django, Flask**.
- #### Application Frameworks:
  These are used to create native application based on the different operating systems like android and iOS.
  - For **Android** we use **React Native**.
  - For **iOS** we use **Swift**.

## Functions of Backend Frameworks:
 - **Routing**: They allow you to define multiple routes for different purposes. Like for sign[in/up] , uploading files, view content etc.
 - **Modularity**: They describes your application into modules, which helps developers to maintain the application.
 - **Reusability**: Frameworks promote code reusability by providing pre-built components and modules, such as libraries, templates, and design patterns.
 - **Testing and Debugging**: They may provide built-in testing and debugging tools, making it easier for developers to identify and fix issues in their applications.
 - **Performance Optimisation**(optional):Some frameworks are designed to provide tools like caching mechanism and load balancer.
 - **ORM's**: Frameworks also provides an Object-Relational Mapper through some libraries, which allow us to use Create,Read,Update and Delete operations on database.
 - **Sessions Management**: They provides a feature for storing user data in a session object

## Functions of Frontend Frameworks:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Frontend frameworks enable developers to create and reuse modular components, making it easier to create complex interfaces.
- **UI Routing**: They provide tools for defining routes on the client-side, for smooth navigation between different parts of a web application without the need for full page reloads.
- **Data Binding**: They facilitate two-way data binding or reactive data binding, automatically updating the user interface when the underlying data changes.
- **Templating**: Frontend frameworks typically include templating engines for dynamic generation of HTML and rendering content.
- **Responsive Design**: Frontend frameworks often come with built-in tools and CSS libraries to help create responsive and mobile-friendly user interfaces.
